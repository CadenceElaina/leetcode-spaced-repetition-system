## The Problem

Aurora's SRS uses identical multipliers for all users:

```
YES:OPTIMAL → 2.5×
YES:SUBOPTIMAL → 2.0×
PARTIAL → 1.1×
NO:NONE → 0.5×
```

In reality, users vary significantly in retention rate:

- A user with strong pattern recognition may retain a Two Pointers problem after 1 review. The 2.5× multiplier is too conservative — they'd be fine at 3.5×.
- A user new to algorithms may need 5 reviews of the same problem before it sticks. The 2.5× multiplier is too aggressive — they fail at the predicted review time and their stability yo-yos.
- The same user may retain Arrays problems easily but struggle with DP problems. Category-level variance exists alongside user-level variance.

### Why This Matters for Pacing

If the SRS overpredicts retention (multiplier too high), the queue underestimates future review load — the user adds new problems thinking they have capacity, then gets hit with failed reviews that halve stability and spike the queue.

If the SRS underpredicts retention (multiplier too low), the user reviews too often — wasting time on problems they already know, which delays coverage and frustrates engaged users.

The pacing system can only be as good as the underlying SRS predictions.

## Current State (v1): Fixed Parameters

### What We Have

- Fixed `INITIAL_STABILITY_BASE = 2.0`
- Fixed `BASE_MULTIPLIERS` table
- Fixed confidence modifiers (+0.3, +0.1, 0, -0.2, -0.4)
- `computeModelCalibration` in `analytics.ts` — can measure predicted-vs-actual accuracy but doesn't feed back into the algorithm

### Why This Is Acceptable for Now

1. **Small user base** — with < 50 active users, per-user calibration would be fitting noise
2. **FSRS research** — the original [FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki) paper shows that fixed parameters produce "good enough" scheduling for ~80% of users when the parameters are well-chosen
3. **Confidence modifier acts as a manual correction** — users who consistently report low confidence get shorter intervals, partially compensating for faster forgetting
4. **The pacing system adds a second layer** — even if the SRS slightly mispredicts, the queue management thresholds catch the resulting queue growth before it becomes a crisis

### What's Missing

- No feedback loop from review outcomes to multiplier values
- No per-category adjustment (DP might need different multipliers than Arrays)
- No detection of systematically miscalibrated users

## Signals Available for Calibration

### Per-Review Calibration Data Point

Every time a user reviews a problem, we can observe:

```
predictedR = computeRetrievability(stability, daysSinceLastReview)
actualOutcome = YES | PARTIAL | NO
```

If `predictedR = 0.85` and the user fails (NO), the model overestimated retention for that problem. Over many reviews, the aggregate pattern reveals the user's actual [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).

This is exactly what `computeModelCalibration` computes — it buckets predicted R values and compares to actual success rates. The `isWellCalibrated` flag triggers when mean absolute error > 0.1.

### Per-User Calibration Signal

After 50+ reviews, we can compute a **personal difficulty factor** (PDF):

```
PDF = actual_success_rate / predicted_success_rate
```

If PDF < 0.9: user forgets faster than predicted → reduce multipliers
If PDF > 1.1: user retains better than predicted → increase multipliers
If 0.9 ≤ PDF ≤ 1.1: model is well-calibrated for this user

### Per-Category Calibration Signal

Same computation, but grouped by problem category:

```
PDF_category = actual_success_rate_in_category / predicted_success_rate_in_category
```

This reveals that a user might be well-calibrated overall (PDF ≈ 1.0) but underpredicted in DP (PDF = 0.7) and overpredicted in Arrays (PDF = 1.2).

## Adaptive SRS Design (v2)

### Prerequisite Data Volume

| Level | Minimum Reviews | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Per-user adjustment | 50 reviews | Low — directional only |
| Per-user adjustment | 100 reviews | Moderate — reliable PDF |
| Per-category adjustment | 20 reviews per category | Low — noisy |
| Per-category adjustment | 50 reviews per category | Moderate — actionable |

Most users reach 100 reviews in 4–6 weeks of regular practice. Per-category data accumulates slower — a user working through the curriculum in order may have 50 Arrays reviews but only 5 Graphs reviews.

### Proposed Adjustment Mechanism

Don't change the base multiplier table. Instead, apply a personal scaling factor:

```
effectiveMultiplier = baseMultiplier * userPDF
```

Where `userPDF` is updated after each review:

```
// Exponential moving average — recent reviews weighted more heavily
const ALPHA = 0.1; // learning rate
const predicted = computeRetrievability(stability, daysSince);
const actual = outcome === "YES" ? 1.0 : 0.0;
userPDF = userPDF * (1 - ALPHA) + (actual / Math.max(0.1, predicted)) * ALPHA;
```

This gradually adjusts the effective multiplier toward the user's actual retention rate without abrupt changes.

#### Known Issue: EMA Volatility Near the Retrievability Floor

When `predicted` is low (near the 0.3 [retrievability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) floor) and the user succeeds, the ratio `actual / predicted` can be very large: `1.0 / 0.35 ≈ 2.86`. Even at ALPHA = 0.1, this produces a single-step push of +0.186 on the PDF — nearly 20% of the full adjustment range.

The [0.5, 2.0] clamp catches the extreme case, but the PDF will be volatile for users who frequently review near the floor (e.g., returning from a break). This is a known limitation of using a multiplicative ratio in an [EMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average).

**Mitigations to explore:**
- Lower ALPHA to 0.05 for users who frequently review near the floor
- Cap the per-step ratio at 2.0 before applying to the EMA: `Math.min(2.0, actual / Math.max(0.1, predicted))`
- Switch to an additive formulation: track `actual - predicted` instead of `actual / predicted`, and apply as an offset rather than a scaling factor
- Use [log-odds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit) space: more stable when predicted R is near 0 or 1

FSRS's own optimizer uses a loss function on the predicted-vs-actual gap (additive), not a ratio (multiplicative). The additive approach is likely more stable but requires a different integration pattern. This is tracked as open research question #5 below.

### Per-Category Extension

```
categoryPDF[category] = categoryPDF[category] * (1 - ALPHA) + (actual / predicted) * ALPHA;
effectiveMultiplier = baseMultiplier * userPDF * categoryPDF[category];
```

### Guardrails

- `userPDF` clamped to [0.5, 2.0] — prevents runaway adjustment from a few bad reviews
- `categoryPDF` clamped to [0.6, 1.6] — narrower range, less data
- Adjustment only starts after `MIN_REVIEWS_FOR_CALIBRATION = 50` reviews
- Adjustment is gradual (ALPHA = 0.1) — takes ~30 reviews for a significant shift
- Per-step ratio capped at 2.0 to limit volatility from low-R reviews (see above)

### Storage

```sql
ALTER TABLE "user" ADD COLUMN "personal_difficulty_factor" REAL DEFAULT 1.0;
-- Or per-category in a separate table:
CREATE TABLE user_category_calibration (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES "user"(id),
  category VARCHAR(100),
  difficulty_factor REAL DEFAULT 1.0,
  review_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, category)
);
```

## What Users Would See

### In the Dashboard

No explicit "your learning rate is X" number. Instead, the system silently adjusts intervals. Users notice:

- Problems they find easy get spaced further apart automatically
- Problems they struggle with come back sooner
- Their queue stabilizes faster because the model is better calibrated

### In Insights

The Insights page could show:

- **Calibration health**: "Your SRS predictions match your actual retention within {n}%" — good calibration means the system is working well for you
- **Category-level signals**: "You retain Arrays problems longer than average but DP problems shorter — scheduling is adjusted accordingly"
- **Trend**: "Your retention rate has improved 12% over the last month" — encouraging signal that practice is working

### In Admin/Research

The admin dashboard would show:

- Aggregate PDF distribution across users (is the fixed 2.5× multiplier too high for most users?)
- Category-level calibration patterns (is DP systematically harder to retain than Arrays?)
- Data to inform adjustments to the base multiplier table

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Observation (Current)

- `computeModelCalibration` exists in `analytics.ts` but is not surfaced anywhere
- No calibration data is stored or tracked
- Action: wire `computeModelCalibration` into the Insights page as a read-only metric

### Phase 1: Track Predicted R at Review Time

- When a user reviews a problem, record `predictedR` alongside the attempt
- This requires adding a column to `attempts` or computing it at insert time
- No algorithmic changes — just data collection

### Phase 2: Compute and Display PDF

- After 50+ reviews, compute `userPDF` and display in Insights
- Show per-category calibration if category has 20+ reviews
- Still no algorithmic changes — the user sees "the model is {well/poorly} calibrated for you"

### Phase 3: Apply PDF to Multipliers

- Multiply base multipliers by `userPDF` in `computeNewStability` and `computeInitialStability`
- Store `userPDF` in the `users` table
- Recalculate on each review (exponential moving average)
- This is the behavioral change — intervals actually adjust

### Phase 4: Per-Category Calibration

- Separate `categoryPDF` stored in a calibration table
- Applied on top of `userPDF`
- Requires more data per category — may only activate for categories with 50+ reviews

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Overfitting to noise** | ALPHA = 0.1 averages over ~30 reviews; clamping prevents extremes; per-step ratio cap at 2.0 |
| **Cold start instability** | PDF only activates after 50 reviews; fixed multipliers used until then |
| **Volatility near R floor** | Cap per-step ratio; consider additive formulation; lower ALPHA for break-returning users |
| **Users game the system** | If a user intentionally fails to get easier intervals, their PDF drops but stability also drops — the system is self-correcting because low stability = more frequent reviews, which is what "gaming" would produce anyway |
| **Complexity** | The user never sees the PDF mechanism. Their experience is just "the app seems to know when I need to review." Complexity is internal only. |
| **Regression** | If PDF makes things worse, the system can be reverted to fixed multipliers by setting `userPDF = 1.0` for all users — no data loss |

## Open Research Questions

1. **What ALPHA value produces the best calibration?** Too high = volatile; too low = slow to adapt. FSRS uses 0.1; we should validate with Aurora-specific data.

2. **Should category PDF be independent or relative to user PDF?** If userPDF = 0.8 and categoryPDF = 1.2, the effective factor is 0.96 — the category-level adjustment partially cancels the user-level one. Is that correct, or should they be additive?

3. **How do confidence modifiers interact with PDF?** If a user's PDF compensates for their forgetting rate, do confidence modifiers still add value, or are they redundant? Preliminary answer: confidence captures *within-session* signal (how the user felt during this specific attempt) while PDF captures *across-session* signal (how the user retains generally). Both are useful.

4. **Does prior exposure (years of experience, CS degree) predict PDF?** If so, we could offer a "prior experience" question during onboarding that initializes PDF closer to the user's likely value, reducing the cold start period.

5. **Should the EMA use a multiplicative ratio or an additive gap?** The current design uses `actual / predicted` (multiplicative), which is volatile when `predicted` is near 0. FSRS's optimizer uses the additive gap `actual - predicted`. The additive approach is more numerically stable but changes the semantics of PDF from a scaling factor to an offset. Evaluate both on real Aurora retention data once Phase 1 data collection is in place.
